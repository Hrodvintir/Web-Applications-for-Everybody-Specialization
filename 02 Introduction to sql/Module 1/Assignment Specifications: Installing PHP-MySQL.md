# Assignment Specifications: Installing PHP/MySQL

In this assignment you will install software that will be used during the course. This software includes a programming text editor and a PHP and MySQL Environment. Also as part of this assignment you will learn how to take screenshots and make them into images. The deliverables of this assignment are two peer-graded images of your running software.

If you follow the instructions carefully and look at the handouts and watch the podcasts, this assignment should be pretty straightforward and take less than an hour.

Note: As you install on Windows, you may be asked for permission to open ports or to allow an application through the firewall - say 'yes' to these dialog boxes if they are popping up when you first install or first start your PHP environment.

If you get stuck on this assignment - feel free to get assistance from anyone who can help. All we want is that you have successfully installed the software and can use it on your system. This is not intended as a difficult or challenging assignment.

You should practice taking a few screen shots on your computer and saving them as PNG or JPG files.

### Specifications
Install a programming text editor if you don't already have one. I recommend Atom, but you can use NotePad++ (Windows) or TextWrangler (Macintosh). You can use any editor you like but TextEdit (Mac), NotePad(Win), and Microsoft Word are *not* acceptable as program editors.

I suggest XAMPP for Windows and MAMP for Macintosh. They all function very similar. But all the course examples will be with MAMP and the course staff will be most familiar with problem arising when you use MAMP so if you choose another environment you should be prepared to do your own tech support.

Navigate to the phpMyAdmin application select the "SQL" tab and type

SELECT 'January 3, 2017'

Replace the example date with the current date, press the "GO" button and then take a screen shot of the resulting page.

Following the instructions in the installation documents, make sure that display_errors = On in your php.ini file. Make the screen shot to show you did it as follows:

For MAMP, go to the phpinfo page in your environment and scroll down until you can take a screen shot showing that your php.ini is correct and take a screen shot

For XAMPP, go to Apache / Config and open the php.ini file and scroll down to show that display_errors = On and take a screen shot.

For Linux, use any editor to open your php.ini file and take a screen shot showing display_errors = On.

Turn those two screen shots in the peer-graded assignment in the: Peer Graded: Installing PHP/MySQL link.

### Sample Screen Shots
The first screen shot for the peer-graded portion of the assignment is the phpMyAdmin as follows:

Don't worry about having fewer databases on the left hand side in your screen shot since you just finished installing your server.

Here a sample of the second screen shot in the peer-graded portion is to verify that display_errors is On in your PHP configuration:

Here is a sample of a screenshot if you are using XAMPP:
