### Pre-Requisites
Please install the [Web Developer Toolkit](https://chrispederick.com/) for your browser from Chris Pedrick and know how to use it to disable CSS styles.

[CSS Sample Code (Browse)  ](https://www.wa4e.com/code/css/index.htm)

[CSS Sample Code Zip (Download)  ](https://www.wa4e.com/code/css.zip)

### Specifications
Take [this](https://www.wa4e.com/assn/css/index.txt) file and copy/paste the contents into index.htm. Do not edit this file.

Take [this](https://www.wa4e.com/assn/css/blocks.txt) file and copy/paste the contents into blocks.css in the same folder as the above file.

Edit the blocks.css and add the CSS rules so the HTML file looks like the above image when you view the index.htm file in your browser

The four boxes have five pixel borders with different colors and five pixels of margin and padding. It is probably simplest to use fixed positioning to get the boxes to be "sticky" to the corners of the screen even when you resize. Make the boxes width be 25% so the width changes as you resize your browser.

Center the link at the top of the page. Use your developer console / inspect element feature of your browser to visit https://www.brainyquote.com/ and find the nav element as shown. There are 2 rules, the 1st starts with a color hint of #f, and the 2nd with #35. Use the full values for the colors and apply them to the link color & background in your index.htm.  

Your CSS must pass the validator at: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator

### What To Hand In
For this assignment you will submit

 - Image (JPG or PNG) of your index.htm with the styling applied, not the HTML source code

 - Image (JPG or PNG) of the source code of your blocks.css file

 - Image (JPG or PNG) of your blocks.css passing the W3 CSS validator
