# Submitting your code to the autograder

Starting with this assignment, some of the auto graders will need to contact your application to test it over the Internet. Since your computer normally has a firewall to block incoming connections from the Internet (a very good thing), we need a special program to temporarily "make a tunnel" through your firewall so the auto grader can contact the Apache server running on your local computer.

You can use NGrok to make this tunnel through your firewall.  We provide documentation on how to use this application below as well as video walkthroughs both on YouTube and Coursera.
