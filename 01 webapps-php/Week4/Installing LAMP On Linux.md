# Installing LAMP On Linux

We don't have a video about how to install the software on Linux since there are many different Linux systems and most Linux users already know how to install software.  In the Linux world, what we call "MAMP" or "XAMPP" is called "LAMP".  Actually LAMP came first and the XAMPP / MAMP names are homage to the original Linux / LAMP.

A simple approach is to search for "How to install LAMP on Ubuntu" - put your variant of Linux in the search - You should find lots of pages.  If we find good guides, we will list them here:
