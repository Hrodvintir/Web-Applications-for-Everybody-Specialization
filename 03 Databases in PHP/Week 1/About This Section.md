# About This Section

The resources in this section originally appeared in course 1 of this Specialization: Building Web Applications in PHP. If you've already completed that course, feel free to skip ahead! If you haven't completed course 1, we recommend that you review the resources in this section, as they provide instructions on setting up the development environment you'll need to have in order to complete the assignments in this course.
